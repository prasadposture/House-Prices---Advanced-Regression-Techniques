# House Prices : Advanced Regression Techniques
I created this project for kaggle competition. It includes exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. In here, I used multiple regression algorithms and chose the one with highest accuracy which was `GradientBoostingRegressor()`, further peformed hyper-parameter tuning. After training the tuned model over the entire train data
I used it for making predictions over the test data where. It offers the RMSE of 0.12938. I have also built a multi-page streamlit web application that takes input from the user and predicts the sale price. Along with predictions this web application also contains interactive visuals so that user could understand how different attributes affect each other.
