# House Prices : Advanced Regression Techniques
I created this project for kaggle competition. It includes exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. In here, I used multiple regression algorithms and chose the one with highest accuracy which was `GradientBoostingRegressor()`, further peformed hyper-parameter tuning. After training the tuned model over the entire train data
I used it for making predictions over the test data where. It offers the RMSE of 0.12938. I'm planning to build a web-app using plotly dash.
